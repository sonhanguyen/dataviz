## Examples

Here are some examples:

```{python}
print("Execute some code chunk and show the result")
```

Codechunks which contain lines without output (e.g. assign the result or comments) will
be shown in the same code block:

```{python}
# A comment
text = "All code in the same code block until some output is produced..."
more_text = "...and some more."
print(text)
print(more_text)
```

### Code chunk arguments

You can use different arguments in the codechunk declaration. Using `echo=FALSE` will not show
the code but only the result.

```{python echo=FALSE}
print("Only the output will be visible as `echo=FALSE`")
```

The next paragraphs explores the code chunk argument `results`. 

If 'hide', knitpy will not display the code's results in the final document. If 'hold', knitpy
will delay displaying all output pieces until the end of the chunk. If 'asis', knitpy will pass
through results without reformatting them (useful if results return raw HTML, etc.)

`results='hold'` is not yet implemented.

```{python results="hide"}
print("Only the input is displayed, not the output")
```

```{python results="markup", echo=FALSE}
print("This is formatted as markdown:\n**This text** will be bold...")
```

```{python results="asis", echo=FALSE}
print("**This text** will be bold...")
```

**Note**: with python code it is recommended to use the IPython/Jupyter display system and an 
appropriate wrapper (see below) to display such output and not `results="asis"`. This makes it 
possible to convert such output if the output can't be included in the final format.

You can also not show codeblocks at all, but they will be run (not included codeblock sets
`have_run = True`):

```{python include=FALSE}
have_run = True
print("This will not be shown, as include is False")
```

```{python include=TRUE}
if have_run == True:
    print("'have_run==TRUE': ran the codeblock before this one.")
```

Using `eval=FALSE`, one can prevent the evaluation of the codechunk

```{python}
x = 1
```

```{python eval=FALSE}
x += 1 # this is not executed as eval is False
```

```{python}
x # still 1
```


To remove/hide a codechunk completely, i.e. neither execute it nor show the code, you can use both `eval=FALSE, include=FALSE`: nothing will be
shown between this text ...

```{python eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
x += 1 # this is not executed and not even shown
```

... and this text here!

The prefix in front of text output (per default `##`) can be changed via the `comment` chunk
option to a different string or completely removed by setting it to a empty string `""`or None:

```{python comment="# result:"}
print("Text output")
```

```{python comment=""}
print("Text output")
```

```{python sinus, echo=FALSE}
# As this all produces no output, it should go into the same input section...
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = np.linspace(2, 10)
line, = plt.plot(y, np.sin(y))
```
